Informatikdidaktik Studienplan Scraping
====================

Scrapes Uni and TU Vienna websites for courses from study Informatikdidaktik and stores them in an XML which can be viewed in the browser due to XSLT.

Prerequisites
---------------------

For running the Python script, Python 2.7 is necessary (maybe a lower version works too) and the Python lib lxml.
The generated xml file can be viewed in IE, Firefox or Chrome, but due to a bug in Chrome, it only works if the xml is located on a web url.
